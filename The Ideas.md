# Games

## Wartales Coop

> Seems pretty fun - seems longish, less story but still has some decisions, kind of sand boxy, dnd esque, coop bros said coop solid.
> seems fun if we want turn based and more open ended with some direction.

## Borderlands 3

> Something we know and have played before.

## Portal 2

> Same as above

## Dying Light 2

> NOPE NOPE NOPE

## Sniper Elite 5

> Seems pretty solid TBH if you are still liking sniping games, sniping together at the same time would be fun, or covering etc.
> but its not much more than a sniping shooter game, the extras of skills and extra new guns etc are mostly going to be pick best gun etc

## Tiny Tinas

> too Borderlandsy - indeed it is, could be fun to play with Jess-Ay if she wants to try a FPS
>
> But probably a No go for us, seemed pretty meh
> too much overlap to everyone

## Elden Ring

> Probably Too Frustrating
> harderish to setup, probably not the right thing to play unless we both loved the game.
> seemed a lot of seperation and then hopping together, doing stuff 2x
>
> NOPE NOPE

## Rainbow Six Extraction

> Could be fun but seems a little much for just 2 people. seems like almost a souls like difficulty or something. seems pretty tough but maybe fun idk. Seems lame with just 2 ppl
> Buddy Pass - So only one of us needs it - So i can buys it :D - only playable for 14 days tho... twice, so would be hard for us

## Ghost Recon

### Breakpoint

> People Seemed to like it fine - <https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakPoint/comments/wwppuk/is_this_a_good_game_to_play_coop_with_only_one/>
> Seems overall people didnt like it though

### Wildlands

> Peoiple seemed to like it better, neither seemed that fantastic but might be ok on sale or something, idk

## Risk of Rain 2

> Fun game, Roguelike - seems like mick had the other game in mind instead which im down for - I just have this and know its fun, only played solo tho.
>
> They said Coop was suuuuper buggy and kept crashing. but was from quite a while ago and might be ok now? if you like this typoe of game is fun.
> other one you mentioned should be fun too though.
> there also like a crab roguelike thats fun too supposedly

## Outriders

> Probably not the play, more like a Destiny 2 Gameplay loop, more of a looter shooter just run through and kill stuff and get powers, like a Gears and Destiny game
>
> their review is pretty old and their is a new xpac open for it, so a looter shooter thats not forcing dungeans maybe? idk also on sale
> probably not what we are wanting cause its another grindy game mmo
> probably not much difficulty until the end of the game
>
> it def seems to highlight coop more than like destiny though but pretty much only shooty shooty stuff
>
> I think this would be mostly a genre choice which we might not like, also might be nice to have a 3rd, but also saw people saying its soloable so...

## Wargroove 2

> Fire Emblem Like game -
> Seems solid, unsure what COOP they have, sounds like maybe a campaign? but maybe jsut battles to play, so might not be a thing? might be too short
> coop wise, seems single player focused

## Outward

> Old game, could be frustratingly hard, but is built more for more people and could be fun to work together, though is pretty open ended and tough. need to look up more
>
> Oldish RPG feel, so noit sure if youd like it, they seem to enjoy it and said it had a dark souls feel so might be too frustrating.
> some minor frustrations
> might be a bit too difficult though especially as a first forray into this type of game, they seemed to like it tho

## MythForce

> Seems Middling - most of whats bad is bad progression and Switch port, so down if its something ur wanting
> seems like thier might be better options or wait for them to make it better

## Back 4 Blood

> Left for Dead type of Game, seemed good coopy type of game, the only issue they had was a bug that probably fixed?
> Seems playable on 2 people and can fill in with bots if we wanted
>
> probably wait till on sale - sounds like only 1 needs to own dlc tho!

## Divinity Original Sin 2

> Should play at some point, but not with yall playing BG3 so soon

## We were Here

> would be fun to play, seems just ok? idk is free to give it a try tho!

## Deep Rock Galactic

> UNSURE - TO LOOK UP, but i think we would end up with randos

## Jagged Alliance 3

> Unsure - TO LOOK UP

## Ship Of Fools

> Seems fun!

## My Top Ideas
